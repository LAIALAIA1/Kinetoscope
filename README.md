# Kinetoscope
My graduation project for NIFFF 2015

For the passed few years the Haute Ecole Arc of Neuchatel sets up an interactive
application that brings together technology and art at the Neuchatel International Fantastic
Film Festival (NIFFF).

Kinetoscope is a project designed and imagined by Manuel Schmalstieg (http://ms-studio.net/) which consists in developing an application that would imitate an X ray wall. This idea comes from the Tintin comic. Passers by will have their silhouette detected using Microsoft's Kinect and a skeleton mapped to their movement is displayed on a big screen. When another user looks at the passer by through the screen, the skeleton will be placed correctly respecting the perspective inherent to the observer to give an illusion of continuity between reality and the image of the skeleton.

See below some photos of Kinetocope during the NIFFF opening cocktail.
